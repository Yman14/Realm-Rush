[problem with collider]
if the sphere collider of tower is on then i cant place the tower to some tiles
however if i remove it then i can place as many tower as possible
no solution yet
im tired
theory - it probably have to do with how i place the tower in the tile or scene and how it interact with the collider
check with the related script

found the problem - onmousedown

... ... ... 

bug - if a tower placed at the end of the tiles and its current target was not killed but reach the end of the world then it will just keep shooting even after the enemy disappeared

posible solution - change the tag of the end to "DeadEnemy" if they reach the end of the world;

keycode
x = show placeable tile
c = show coordinates

level 0

[Clear Condition]
required gold: 300
boss kill: 1

[instruction]
place 5 towers in optimal position then wait for gold to reach 300
once the boss was summoned then use all gold to buy towers
